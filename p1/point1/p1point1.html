	<h1>3 Topics</h1>

	<h2>Paralympics</h2>

<p> Since I was young, I have gravitated towards watching the Paralympics instead of its mainstream counterpart. The 2024 Paris Paralympics was no exception. The 2024 Paralympics made history in terms of gender, racial, and ethnic representation within their athletes. I think it would be interesting to create a website page that covers specific examples of those athletes, as I’ve been fascinated by the discussion of representation within sports. It would also include a brief history of how the Paralympics was created. </p>

	<h2>Korean Cuisine</h2>

	<p> Having a grandmother from South Korea, my mother always wanted us to remember our heritage. Therefore, it’s common in our household to have authentic south Korean food. Specifically, food that we had when we stayed with our grandmother. For this topic, I would pick a few South Korean foods that I ate in my childhood. Each food would have its own section that would describe the ingredients and how it’s typically prepared. It would also contain historical research regarding their creations. </p>
	
	<h2> The Intersection of Queerness and Editorials</h2>

  <p>The goal for this topic would be to shine a light on queer history within the art space . I would like to find older and recent examples of queer magazines/zines to create a chronological timeline. The most recent would be near the top of the page and the oldest at the bottom. In each section, there would be brief descriptions of a magazine’s/zine’s content with visual examples. However, I would focus on the historical context around their creations and the queer identities of the people who created them.  </p>
